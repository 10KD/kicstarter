# Kicstarter

Kicstarter is a crowdfunding platform inspired by Kickstarter. It's a fullstack application built with a Ruby on Rails backend, PostgreSQL database, and React-Redux on the frontend. Much like Kickstarter, users can create projects with fund raising goals. Other users can then browse and back those projects. 

Kicstarter was created in 8 days by Don Kim.
